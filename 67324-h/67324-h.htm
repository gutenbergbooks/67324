<h1>PLACEBO</h1>

<h2>By DAVID MASON</h2>

<p><i>Each 1955 was worse than the last!</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>The object appeared in the middle of Main Way, about fifty feet from
the statue of Vachel Lindsay, and at least a hundred from anything
else. It was much too big and complicated to have been hidden anywhere,
and it hadn't any wheels, tracks, wings, or other visible means of
movement.</p>

<p>Corrigan, looking the object over, decided that it could not have
come from any logical place in the world. Not being prejudiced, he
then thought a little about the illogical places, and the places that
weren't in the world. Corrigan decided that it must be another attempt
at time travel, and he clucked his tongue sympathetically.</p>

<p>Well, someone had to break the news. Corrigan arose from the grass and
walked toward the object.</p>

<p>There was a young man sitting in the object, on a sort of high
saddle. He looked a little wild-eyed, and he seemed to be talking to
himself, as he pulled and twisted at the rows of controls in front of
him. Corrigan, looking up at him, decided that he couldn't be very
healthy, and that the stiff gray garments he wore must be extremely
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Greetings, traveler," Corrigan called.</p>

<p>"You're speaking Anglish!" the young man exclaimed. "Good! Maybe I can
get some help here. What year is this?"</p>

<p>"1955, by most systems."</p>

<p>The young man turned a little paler.</p>

<p>"I've just left 1955," he said unhappily. "Four times, in fact. Four
different 1955's. And each one's a bit worse. Now the machine won't
work."</p>

<p>"Your theory's wrong," Corrigan said calmly. "Hasn't it occurred to you
yet that time travel might be impossible?"</p>

<p>The young man made a choked sound. He began to climb down from his
perch, keeping his eyes fixed suspiciously on Corrigan as he did so.
He saw Corrigan as a small brown man, dressed in loose blue trousers,
barefooted, and with a puff of white hair that seemed never to
have been properly cut. The lawns and grassy roads, the bright and
impermanent-looking buildings, and Corrigan himself, all added up to
one thing in the young man's mind.</p>

<p>"You're wrong," Corrigan said. "I'm not a lunatic, and this isn't an
asylum. We don't have them."</p>

<p>The young man, on the ground now, stared at Corrigan in evident horror.</p>

<p>"Mind reading?"</p>

<p>"More or less," Corrigan said. "It saves time. For instance, you're
Darwin Lenner, and you'd like very much to get back to wherever you
started from. In fact, you have to, or something unpleasant might
happen to you, by your standards."</p>

<p>"I'd be absent without permission," Lenner admitted. "I ... I wish you
wouldn't do that."</p>

<p>"Only when absolutely necessary," Corrigan smiled. "I'm a philosopher
by trade, myself, not a mind reader. My name's Philip Corrigan, and
I'd be very glad to help you on your way ... but I think it might be a
little difficult. We aren't really a very mechanically-minded people
here."</p>

<p>Lenner ran his hands through his hair. "I've <i>got</i> to get back. Isn't
there anybody who knows something about time machines?"</p>

<p>Corrigan had been thinking swiftly. He had also been carrying on a
conversation which Lenner could not possibly hear, with a man who was
several miles away.</p>

<p>"<i>Burwell, he wants to go home.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Fine. He ought to. Why doesn't he?</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>He lost his confidence. He thinks his machine's broken down.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>That kind, eh? I suppose the thing never really did work very well.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Most of them don't. They go traveling around hit-or-miss through
probability under the operator's own mental steam&mdash;but this fellow
probably comes from a world where an idea like that's illegal.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Sounds like it. Corrigan, take him on a guided tour or something, and
keep him busy. I'll be over as soon as I can. I'm going to do something
for his self-confidence. Here's the story to give him....</i>"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Corrigan had always enjoyed conducting guided tours, and he was
enjoying this one especially well. He had a slightly wicked taste for
complicated teasing, and Lenner was a perfect object. He had evidently
come from one of the more unpleasant probabilities, a world full of
complex rules and harshly restrictive; everything that he saw bothered
him. The handsome girls, wearing unstrategically placed flowers and
very little else; the flocks of children, as plentiful as pigeons and
apparently as free of supervision; the almost total absence of anybody
actually performing useful work ... all of it contributed to Lenner's
increasing nervousness.</p>

<p>The guided tour went in a wide circle, and Lenner and Corrigan wound up
sitting in a tavern facing on Main Way. Lenner ignored the green drink
before him and peered unhappily out the big window toward his machine.</p>

<p>"Where <i>is</i> that friend of yours?" he asked, for the fifth time.</p>

<p>"He'll be here," Corrigan assured him. "Why hurry? Don't you like it
here?"</p>

<p>Lenner's mouth hardened. He looked around him, and shook his head.</p>

<p>"No." He spoke almost apologetically, "I'm sorry ... well, look, old
fellow, no hard feelings, I hope. But this world of yours is primitive.
Degenerate, I'd say."</p>

<p>"Primitive?"</p>

<p>"No laws&mdash;not even morals! Those girls ... and of course, you don't
have any civilized advantages. Not even ground transportation. That
man you spoke of has to <i>walk</i> here. And that's something else I don't
understand. You say he's another time traveler...."</p>

<p>"Probability traveler, actually," Corrigan corrected.</p>

<p>"All right, probability. Why does he stay here? Why would a really
intelligent man give up civilization?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know how it is. He's gone native, you might say. Life among
the lotus eaters, and all that. Might happen to anybody, even yourself."</p>

<p>Lenner shuddered.</p>

<p>"It's all right, though." Corrigan continued. "He'll be here any
minute, and I'm sure he'll be able to help. Knows all there is to know
about these machines. In fact, here he comes now."</p>

<p>Burwell entered, and Corrigan could hardly suppress a small chuckle.
Burwell had picked up Lenner's ideas about what a man of intelligence
and authority ought to look like, and had gone to some trouble to look
the part. He was wearing a uniform of some sort, spectacles, and an
expression of extreme wisdom.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can repair what's wrong," Burwell told Lenner. "Let's go
and look at your machine."</p>

<p>Arriving, Burwell climbed over the mechanism with an air of bored
ability, occasionally thumping at something, adjusting something else,
or hitting a part with a tool until it rang. He muttered to himself
as he worked, allowing the sound of his musings to drift in Lenner's
direction.</p>

<p>"Umm ... badly twisted impeller ... the varish is more or less
waffled ... let's see if ... ah, there we are."</p>

<p>He climbed down and solemnly shook hands with Lenner.</p>

<p>"Fine machine you've got there, my boy. It'll take you back to your
own place quite easily now. There wasn't a thing wrong except the drift
crotch. However, I wouldn't use it again if I were you. There's no real
control on these things. A man could end up anywhere. And of course,
you'd never find your way back here, without control."</p>

<p>"Well, thanks..." Lenner said doubtfully. He glanced around. "It's a
shame there's no way we could regularly communicate between our worlds.
There's a lot we could do for this one."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of that," Burwell said, hastily looking away. "But it isn't
worth the danger and difficulty of reaching us. For myself, it doesn't
matter any more." He assumed a nobly tragic expression. "But you are
young; you've got your life ahead of you; your State and your society
need you. I'm glad to help you on your way."</p>

<p>Lenner mounted the machine, and Burwell beamed a thought at Corrigan.</p>

<p>"<i>I've convinced him that the thing works, and that it would not be
easy to come back. Actually, that machine of his is a real work of art.
It doesn't do a damn thing. This boy comes from a place where they
have to have a mechanical crutch for everything. His gadgets are pink
pill stuff ... something to convince him he can do things he could do
anyway. All we have to do now is give him a small mental shove to help
him along, and he'll be home in no time. All right, now&mdash;SHOVE!</i>"</p>

<p>Corrigan and Burwell shoved. Lenner and his machine faded and were
gone, leaving only a flattened place on the grass.</p>

<p>"Brrr," Burwell said. "Am I glad that worked! If he'd stayed another
week or so we would have had our first lunatic of the century."</p>

<p>"Or worse," Corrigan said, stirring the grass with his toes. "Did you
get what he was thinking about when he talked about his world and ours
getting into touch, and civilizing us?"</p>

<p>"I got it, all right." Burwell said. "The fellow's mind was a swamp. A
real primitive. And just like any other primitive, all he needed was a
placebo from a witch doctor. Me, in my savage regalia. Just let me get
this thing with the glass in it off my nose, and these button things
opened up a bit, and we can get on with that chess game. I hope the
next traveler picks somewhere else to land, though&mdash;I've never felt so
silly in my life!"</p>
